3 blinking lights with button-
  3 lights connected and 1 button. when the button is pressed, the lights blink.
  
color and laser sensor-
  2 photoresistors connected, 1 relay and one RGB sensor.
  When the photoresistors recieve laser, they active a relay that opens an electronic lock.
  after that, RGB sensor tries to find a spesific color
  
color sensor-
  RGB sensor is connected and prints the RGB values of colors it senses
  
laser photoresistor-
  2 photoresistors are connected. When both with value under 30, both of them sense a laser
  
unknown resistor-
  One known resistor is connected and another unknown resistor. The program finds the value of the unknown resistor
